- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui under system information this is incorrect
API ENDPOINTS
/api/config/* - Configuration API
/proxy/* - Reverse Proxy
/actuator/* - Health Monitoring

call this just ENDPOINTS and for description indicate if this is proxyima endpoint or dynamic route with forwarding. use shorter descriptions than this.

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/headers under Header Testing clicking on test headers incorreclty redirects to http://localhost:8080/anything. instead it should test headers on one of the dynamic routes that is configured. 

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/headers  view raw headers also doesn't work as points to http://localhost:8080/headers . remove the button 

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/headers  copy curl also needs to point to dynamic route and not curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/anything

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/headers text under Sample Test Command: curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/anything is also incorrect and should point to working dynamic route. 

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/headers description 'Modify preset configurations in your application.yml file' is incorrect. as most of the people will use this though docker image describe config though json file and how that file needs to be passed to the docker container showing docker-compose up sample file.

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/headers 'Use environment variables to override header values' is not correct, remove it

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/presets when clicking on activate preset, previous preset still shows active

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/routes clicking on test route results in error. url contructed is http://localhost:8080/api/config/routes/test/api%2Fusers%2F123 which is incorrect. fix the test url ro use one of dynamic routes and show response body and status as result

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/routes Configuration Instructions are wrong, json is now used

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/routes clicking on view json api points to  http://localhost:8080/api/config/routes, it should be using proxima system url for api

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/jwt is there a need for HMAC Keys? if not remove all code related hmac as we are not using it for oauth tokens generation. 

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/jwt after clicking on genrate token - this token should be used in all subsequent requests as authorization bearer token (remember it in memory and add to all proxy requests). for this reason remove all authorization bearer tokens for sample configs. 

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/jwt after clicking on delete key button, key still shows up

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/jwt after clicking on button to view public key and testing it on jwt.io it looks like it is neither in PEM or jwk format. fix this

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/status under API Endpoints same issues as with  http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui  call this just ENDPOINTS and for description indicate if this is proxyima endpoint or dynamic route with forwarding. use shorter descriptions than this.

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/status under Quick Diagnostics when clicking on test proxy url http://localhost:8080/proxy/anything is used - use one of the dynamic routes

- on http://localhost:8080/proxima/ui/status what was the intention with header test , it tries http://localhost:8080/proxy/headers. it should be removed as it does same as test proxy 

- in swagger docs half of the endpoints are under config-controller and another half is under Configuration make sure everythig is under Configuration
